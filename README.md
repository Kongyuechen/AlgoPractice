# AlgoPractice

This will be where I will show how I practice solving algo problems
while explaining my thoughts during solving the problem.

Each folder will be a month and each file will have the date and question number
from leet code.

# Goals
I hope to continue to get better and also explain my thought process
in a more fluid way.
I hope to progress to more challenging questions as days goes on.
